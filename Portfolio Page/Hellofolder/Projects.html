               <big> Till now I have worked on three circuit related project.<br>
                First one is a prototype of <b>Line following and obstacle avoiding car.</b><br>
                Second is an <b>Industrial Object Counter.</b><br>
                Third is a prototype for <b>Comparison and Measurement of Gases released on burning Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable plastic.</b><br> 
                Here are some images of that protoytpe.
